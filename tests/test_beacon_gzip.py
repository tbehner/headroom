"""Beacon upload compression, and the fallback that makes it safe to ship.

A schema-v2 event is ~8KB of repetitive JSON and gzips ~6x, which is worth more
than every schema trim available put together. The risk is not the compression;
it is that uploads are fire-and-forget, so an endpoint that cannot read a
gzipped body looks exactly like an endpoint that is working. These tests cover
the compression, and then the three ways it is allowed to stop.

The server here re-implements worker.js's sniff-and-inflate in Python. It is not
the Worker, and cannot prove `DecompressionStream` behaves — but it does pin the
wire contract the two halves have to agree on, which is the part that would
otherwise only be checked in production.
