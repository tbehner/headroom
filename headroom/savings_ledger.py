"""Durable append-only savings event ledger.

Every compression — interactive ``headroom_compress`` MCP calls *and* proxy
requests — appends a single JSON line to a file-locked JSONL ledger. Unlike the
in-memory ``SessionStats`` and the 2-hour ``session_stats.jsonl`` window, this
ledger survives proxy/agent restarts and is safe across concurrent writers
(the main MCP server, each subagent's MCP server, and the proxy all append to
the same file under an advisory lock). ``headroom savings`` aggregates it on
read, so there is no shared mutable state to clobber and totals stay accurate.

Cost is computed and stored at write time so historical numbers do not drift if
model pricing changes later. litellm list pricing is used where the model is
known; a blended input-token rate is used as a fallback (MCP-tool compressions
do not know the agent's upstream model, so they record ``model="unknown"`` and
fall back to the blended rate rather than recording ``$0``).

Schema v2 additionally records the SHAPE of each event, not just the dollar it
produced:

* ``saved_compression`` / ``saved_tool_schema`` — the two savings layers kept
  apart. They sit in different regions of the prompt and price at different
  rates (see :mod:`headroom.pricing.counterfactual`), so an event storing only
  their sum cannot be priced correctly at all.
* ``cache`` — the request's observed read/write/uncached mix.
* ``cost_effective_usd`` — the cache-aware figure, alongside the unchanged
  list-priced ``cost_usd``.

That distinction is what v1 got wrong and could not recover from. v1 stored one
list-priced dollar and no mix, so its historical numbers were not merely
overstated — they were *unfixable*, because nothing on disk said what fraction
of the removed tokens would have been cache reads. Write-time pricing keeps its
original virtue (numbers do not drift when a price list changes) without the
vice (numbers cannot be corrected when the BASIS was wrong): the inputs are on
disk, so a future basis change can re-derive the whole ledger.

v1 events still read: they report their stored list dollar as both figures and
carry ``basis="list"``, so a mixed ledger stays legible rather than silently
blending two meanings.
