"""Binary spreadsheet ingestion: ``.xlsx`` / ``.xls`` → tabular text.

The compression pipeline is text-only, so binary spreadsheets enter through this
adapter at the SDK boundary. Each sheet is rendered to CSV text, which then flows
through the normal tabular detection → SmartCrusher path like any other table.

Parsers are optional dependencies (``pip install headroom-ai[spreadsheet]``) and
are imported lazily; a missing dependency fails loudly with an actionable
message rather than silently degrading.
