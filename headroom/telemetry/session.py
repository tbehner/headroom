"""Session aggregation for the anonymous telemetry beacon.

One wide event per session, emitted when the session goes idle. Everything here
is off unless ``HEADROOM_TELEMETRY`` is explicitly on — see
:mod:`headroom.telemetry.beacon`.

# What counts as a session

A contiguous burst of proxy activity from one install, closed after
``IDLE_TIMEOUT_S`` of quiet. This is the web-analytics definition (GA uses a
30-minute inactivity window) and it is deliberately *not* keyed on conversation
content.

The alternative was to key sessions on
:func:`headroom.proxy.output_savings_policy.conversation_key_from_body`, which
is stable across the turns of one agent loop. That was rejected twice over:

* It is content-derived — a SHA256 over the first 512 chars of the first user
  message. Exporting it, even blinded, puts a function of the user's prompt on
  the wire. For a proxy whose entire promise is safe prompt handling, that is
  the wrong default, and defending it in a threat model costs more than the
  grouping is worth.
* ``RequestOutcome`` is built at 30 sites across six handlers, and the parsed
  body is not available at any shared chokepoint (the HTTP middleware sees
  headers only — see ``set_current_project`` at ``proxy/server.py``). Plumbing
  a conversation key to all of them is a large diff for a metric nobody has
  asked for yet.

Burst sessions serve every metric the beacon exists for: session count,
duration, turns, tokens saved per session, and retention. What they lose is
conversation *boundaries* — two concurrent conversations merge into one burst.
``turn_id`` is already on every outcome if conversation-level grouping is ever
needed; it can be added without changing this shape.

# Wire format

OTLP/HTTP JSON logs, POSTed straight to the collector. Deliberately *not* the
OTel logs SDK: that API is still ``opentelemetry.sdk._logs`` (underscore =
unstable), and the beacon should not break on an SDK minor bump. The OTLP JSON
wire format is a stable spec and plain stdlib gets us there.

The record body is an OTLP kvlist (not a JSON string) so the collector's
``keep_keys(body, [...])`` allowlist can introspect and drop unknown fields
server-side. That is the only control point for clients already in the wild.

Bodies can be gzipped (``Content-Encoding: gzip``, as OTLP/HTTP specifies). The
kvlist encoding costs about 3.8x over plain JSON -- every integer becomes
``{"intValue":"1200"}`` -- and the result is repetitive enough to compress ~6x,
which is worth several times more than every available schema trim put
together. It also restores the premise the cumulative-snapshot design rests on:
``payload`` justifies re-sending everything on each heartbeat because "the
redundancy is ~2KB per report, which is free", and at schema v2 that report is
~8KB uncompressed and ~1.3KB gzipped. Compression can turn itself off -- see
``_post_blocking`` -- so an endpoint that cannot read it costs a retry, not the
data.

It is nonetheless OFF in this release: v2 and the transport are separate
mechanisms and ship in separate releases, so that a failure in the first is
never ambiguous. See ``_GZIP_DEFAULT``. Note that it saves upload bandwidth
only -- the receiver stores plain NDJSON either way, so corpus size and read
times are identical with it on or off.

# Schema versions

``schema_version: 1`` reported volume: how many tokens moved, which strategies
ran, and how much was saved. It answered "how much did we save?" and nothing
else, because every counter in it is a session-wide SUM and none of them
describes the input.

``schema_version: 2`` is strictly additive — every v1 field keeps its name, its
type and its arithmetic, and the folding for the new signals is isolated in
:func:`_fold_extra` so a bug there cannot reach one. It adds:

* ``quality`` — the regret label. ``reread_compressed_tokens`` is tokens the
  agent had to fetch again *because compression removed them*, which is the
  only thing that makes ``saved_pct`` falsifiable: without it, deleting the
  entire context scores 100%.
* ``hist`` — fixed-bucket distributions for quantities previously reported only
  as totals, since a sum cannot distinguish uniformly-mediocre from bimodal.
  Each ships its own bucket edges, so a row is readable without knowing which
  client version wrote it.
* ``shapes`` — ``(content_type -> strategy -> yield)``, the input term the
  corpus never had. ``by_strategy`` can rank compressors against each other but
  cannot say which one suits a given piece of content, which is the decision
  the router actually makes.
* ``cache`` — prompt-cache hit rate indexed by the gap since the previous turn,
  i.e. an empirical survival curve for a TTL no provider documents accurately.
* ``trajectory`` — the session's shape over time rather than its totals.
* ``clients`` / ``errors`` / ``strata`` / ``config`` — segmentation. 4xx is
  counted in ``errors`` and deliberately NOT folded into ``failures``, which
  has been 5xx-only in every row of the corpus and must stay that way.

Everything added is a counter, a ratio, or a slug from a vocabulary that is
closed in code. Two things are still refused on principle: anything derived
from prompt or file content (which is why ``turn_id`` and TOIN's
``structure_hash`` are absent — both are digests of user data), and the source
IP, which the receiver never reads. ``headroom telemetry --show`` prints the
exact payload, so none of this has to be taken on trust.

#     turns >= 1; otherwise a request abandoned between compression and its
#     outcome (Claude Code users interrupt streaming routinely) would emit a
