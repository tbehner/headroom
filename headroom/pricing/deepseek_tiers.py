"""DeepSeek peak/off-peak pricing structure.

DeepSeek prices DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash (``deepseek-flash``) and DeepSeek-V4-Pro
(``deepseek-v4-pro``) on Beijing-time peak windows, and peak is exactly twice
off-peak. Because the ratio is structural, it is applied here instead of being
transcribed into every row of :mod:`headroom.pricing.deepseek_prices` - a
per-tier table would double the columns, would drift, and would let one tier be
mis-typed without anything noticing.

Windows are Beijing wall time (a fixed UTC+8; the PRC has no daylight saving):
09:00-12:00 and 14:00-18:00, which are the published 01:00-04:00 and
06:00-10:00 UTC windows. Weekends are all-day off-peak only from
:data:`WEEKEND_OFF_PEAK_FROM`; before that instant they still followed the
weekday windows, so a back-dated or replayed request is not silently repriced.

Prices are the vendor's own USD list. The zh-cn page lists the same tiers in
CNY, but the two lists are not one FX apart, so CNY billing needs a switch over
two published lists rather than a baked rate - not modelled here.

Consumers that need one flat number for a model take :func:`off_peak_rates`
(the cheaper published tier). Consumers pricing a real request take
:func:`rates_for` with that request's instant.
